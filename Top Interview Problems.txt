	->	Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
	
	Two pointer approach from start one and from last another to keep swapping.

public class Solution {
    public void ReverseString(char[] s) {
        int length = s.Count();
        int i = 0;
        int j = length - 1;

        while (i<j)
        {
            //swap s[i] , s[j]
            char temp = s[i];
            s[i] = s[j];
            s[j] = temp;
            i++; j--;
        }

        for(int z=0; z<length; z++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(s[z]);
        }
